/**
 * Command implementation to build an input graph. A valid line example for this
 * command would be:<br/>
 * <b>Graph: AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8</b><br/>
 * where AB5 represents and edge between vertex A and B with a cost of 5. There
 * is no upper limit on the amount of edges that can be specified on the line
 * but at least 1 is required. Vertex are assumed to be single letters. Note
 * that this class is package private to prevent it from being instantiated from
 * outside. Instances of this class are only created in {@link CommandBuilder}.
 * This requires the client to refer to the returned object by its interface
 * rather than its implementation class, which is generally good practice
 * 
 * @see DistanceCommand
 * @see TripsCommand
