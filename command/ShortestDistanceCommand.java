/**
 * Command implementation to a shortest distance input. A valid line example for
 * this command would be:<br/>
 * <b>Shortest: A-B</b><br/>
 * where A and B represent the starting and ending vertex, respectively. The
 * upper and lower limit for the number of vertex on the specified path is 2.
 * Vertex are assumed to be single letters. Note that this class is package
 * private to prevent it from being instantiated from outside. Instances of this
 * class are only created in {@link CommandBuilder}. This requires the client to
 * refer to the returned object by its interface rather than its implementation
 * class, which is generally good practice
